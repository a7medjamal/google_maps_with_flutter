# maps_app

A new Flutter project.

## Features

- **Google Maps Integration**: Display and interact with maps directly within the app.
- **Location Search**: Search for locations and view them on the map.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Smooth map transitions, zoom functionality, and more.


###Note
For security reasons, files containing sensitive information (such as AndroidManifest.xml and AppDelegate.swift with the Google Maps API key) are excluded from this repository. You must add your own API key in the appropriate files.


<meta-data
    android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY"
    android:value="YOUR_API_KEY"/>
iOS: Open ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift and configure the Google Maps API key as follows:

swift
Copy code
GMSServices.provideAPIKey("YOUR_API_KEY")
